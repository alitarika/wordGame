Word Game is a web application in which you type the word-translation pair first and then you play to choose the correct translation. It works with mongoDB so your word-translation pairs are stored to be used later on. Simply, create your account with a username and a password, navigate to create word page and create at least 4 word pairs to be able to play the game. If you make mistake, the word you were mistaken is stored differently and you can check them afterwards to target your weak words. In the home page you will also see a random word everytime you navigate to or refresh the word with the button. You can also see all of the words you have created in the word list page either alphabetically or creation time.
You can create your word/translation pairs from Create Word Page. You can also access the page by pressing C + W at the same time once you are logged in. Do not worry if you have made a typo, you can modify the word easily later.

The words you have created will be saved in your personal word list. In this list you can see each of your words, how many words you have as well as if you answered the word correctly or incorrectly the last time you have played Word Game. You can navigate to your word list by pressing W + L at the same time.

In Word Game, word will appear on orange box in the middle and you will answer which one is the correct translation of the word. You may use numbers to answer. On correct answer background will flash green and on wrong answer red. Then, new set of words will appear on your page. Navigate to Word Game by pressing W + G at the same time.

Everytime you visit your homepage, you will see a random word from your word list with the word and its translation. You can press 'Change Word' to get a new word/translation pair.

You will also see all the words you answered wrong in your homepage to make you aware of the words you have failed to recall correctly.

Good Luck Have Fun!
